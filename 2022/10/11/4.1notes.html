<p>at first computers were big and only worked in isolation</p>
<ul>
  <li>however, as time went on, computers became smaller and smaller</li>
  <li>computing devices like routers were also invented</li>
  <li>however computers were still working alone</li>
  <li>
    <p>the users of computers needed them to be able to communicate with other devices</p>
  </li>
  <li>computers communicate with binary, which is combines into “packets”</li>
  <li>computer networks were created for computers to be able to send packets to each other</li>
  <li>a computer network is a group of interconnected computers that send data to each other</li>
</ul>

<p>Packet Switching:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a file/message is sent by being broken up into packets along a path</li>
  <li>the packages can be sent in any order, since they are rearranged back into order by the receiving computer</li>
  <li>routers are used to “guide” packages to their destination by finding the correct path</li>
</ul>

<p>Bandwidth: the max amount of data that can be sent within a certain period of time on a computer network (speed)</p>
<ul>
  <li>usually measured in bits per second</li>
  <li>the more information there is on a network, the slower it becomes</li>
</ul>

<p>Why do computers need to communicate?</p>
<ul>
  <li>communicating/sharing data makes a lot of tasks easier</li>
</ul>

<p>Why are packets used to transmit data?</p>
<ul>
  <li>an entire file can’t be moved across the internet in one go</li>
  <li>packets are used to send the file in separate pieces</li>
</ul>

<p>Vocab:</p>
<ul>
  <li>path: sequence of connected computers/computing devices. The path starts at the sender and ends at the receiver</li>
  <li>route: the process of finding a path for the packets to reach the receiver</li>
  <li>computer system: a group of computing devices working together to achieve a goal</li>
  <li>computer device: a device that can run a program (like computers, tablets, servers, routers, etc)</li>
  <li>bandwidth: the maximum amount of data a computer can send at a time</li>
  <li>computer network: interconnected computing devices that can send and receive data from each other</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>protocol: an agreed-upon set of rules that spell out the behavior of a system</li>
  <li>Internet Engineering Task Force: discussed the protocols/rules to send info from one computer device to another</li>
</ul>

<p>Network access layer:</p>
<ul>
  <li>deals w/ hardware</li>
  <li>starts w/ something like wifi card</li>
  <li>has a MAC address</li>
</ul>

<p>Internet Protocol Layer (narrow waist):</p>
<ul>
  <li>package is set up w/ metadata – has sender IP and receiver IP</li>
  <li>goes through a path of router</li>
  <li>like passing a note through a class</li>
  <li>there are multiple paths that the package can take – internet is flexible and scalable (it is able to change in size to meet new demands)</li>
</ul>

<p>Transport Layer:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Two most popular protocols: TCP and UDP</li>
  <li>TCP is stricter (makes sure the package has been delivered): uses “three way handshake” to certify delivery</li>
  <li>UDP is more relaxed</li>
</ul>

<p>Application Layer:</p>
<ul>
  <li>DNS: Domain Name Service – translates numbers into a URL readable by humans which directs you to an IP address</li>
  <li>WWW: World Wide Web: network of linked data pages over the Internet (NOT the internet itself)</li>
  <li>http/https: asking to receive data from web servers (https is a more secure version of http)</li>
</ul>
