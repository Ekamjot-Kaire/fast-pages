</ul><p>This lesson plan is not fully complete. Unfortunately I’m traveling right now, so I didn’t have time to finish it up completely. I’m planning to come up with a more concrete plan as soon as I get home on Wednesday. Sorry about that!</p>

<p>Key vocab:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Algorithm (discussed in pt 1)</li>
</ul>

<p>Objectives:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Understand the different types of values that could be stored in variables</li>
  <li>Understand how the order of steps in an algorithm may change the outcome, and be able to track different variables through a procedure</li>
</ul>

<p>Ideas for interactive elements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Show how changing the order of the steps can change the overall algorithm as a whole</li>
  <li>Send a notebook to everyone, and have them change around the order of the steps themselves</li>
  <li>Ask them what they think the outcome will be, then have everyone test the outcome to see if they’re correct</li>
  <li>Show them how to track the values assigned to variables as it changes.</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall Plan: 
1) Discuss different ways variables can be used
2) Discuss and show an example of how changing a procedure can change the result, and how to track the changes 
3) Send a notebook and have everyone test changing steps of a procedure themselves</p>

<p>Ideas for Hacks:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Create a flowchart to demonstrate changes to variables (?)</li>
  <li>Tie in with Sreeja’s hack of creating flowchart for an algorithm, and have a table with changes…</li>
</ul>
