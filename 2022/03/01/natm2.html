<p>The Different Classes:
I visited all the classes, including 3D animation, ceramics, studio art, and drawing and painting. It was inspiring seeing how talented all of the students were. Some of the art pieces even seemed exactly like something you would see at an actual museum gallery. One art piece I liked was this ceramic octopus from Ceramics:</p>

<p>I thought it was very impressive how the tentacles were created. There was a lot of attention to detail in this piece, including how the eyes were shaped like a real octopus, and how the tentacles had ridges on the bottom.</p>

<p>Another piece I liked was from the 3D animation class:</p>

<p>The grass was very realistic.. it almost looked like the image was a real photograph. The layout of the piece also made it feel like a story was being told.</p>
