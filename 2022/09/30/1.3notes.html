<p>–&gt; Starting the development of a program:</p>

<ul>
  <li>it starts w/ an idea</li>
  <li>you need to have a specific purpose in mind when creating the program – what do you want the program to accomplish?</li>
</ul>

<p>(sometimes development changes based on what happens during the process (whether good or bad)</p>

<p>–&gt; Developers then start investigating the problem/purpose:</p>
<ul>
  <li>set requirements for what the program must do</li>
  <li>find and understand constraints (lack of tools, time…)</li>
  <li>understand interests of user</li>
</ul>

<p>ways of investigating include surveys, user testing, observations, interviews</p>

<p>–&gt; After investigation: 
developers begin brainstroming:</p>
<ul>
  <li>draw a storyboard</li>
  <li>planning user experience</li>
  <li>lay out user interface (how will the user interact w/ the program)</li>
  <li>organizing/dividing work</li>
  <li>find a way to test the program</li>
</ul>

<p>–&gt; Program requirements – how should the program behave?:</p>
<ul>
  <li>list of users interactions so that they know what they can actually do w/ the program</li>
  <li>create prototype of program – an incremental process is usually used to test/refine small parts to make sure they work before putting everything together</li>
</ul>

<p>–&gt; Testing:</p>
<ul>
  <li>testing must happen at every step of the way</li>
  <li>Testing must happen at the 
      - micro level: make sure each part works as its supposed to 
      - macro: do all the individual parts interact correctly?</li>
  <li>refine and revise</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Program development is rarely done alone; instead there are usually teams of ppl (some teams include a few ppl while others could include hundreds)</li>
  <li>usually there are multiple people/teams that work on individual components</li>
  <li>everyone must get credit for their work – their names have to written in the documentation of the program</li>
  <li>make sure to credit partners</li>
  <li>
    <p>for some languages you also use comments within the program to give credit – w/ comments, development teams can find out who can/should fix a problem that shows up</p>
  </li>
  <li>many times developers use code segments, algorithms, and procedures done by others – if someone already invented it you don’t have to develop the same thing again</li>
  <li>however, even if they are not part of your team you must credit them: include authors name and source of any code used</li>
  <li>sort of like a works cited</li>
</ul>

<p>programers use somethign called program documentation to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>describe overall program</li>
  <li>list specific functions of program</li>
  <li>describe specific functions or code segments of program</li>
  <li>list events and outputs</li>
  <li>how others can interact with program</li>
  <li>list contributers and other developers of program</li>
</ul>

<p>documentation happens:</p>
<ul>
  <li>at the beginning: list specifications</li>
  <li>while programming to keep track of progress and issues</li>
  <li>after to explain the overall process</li>
</ul>

<p>good documentation can improve:</p>
<ul>
  <li>efficiency</li>
  <li>ability to fix issues/refine the program</li>
  <li>response to bugs</li>
</ul>

<p>how to programmers document while programing:</p>
<ul>
  <li>most languages allow comments</li>
  <li>comments are txt written within the program that are not executed and don’t affect the program</li>
  <li>they are only for developers; computers skip over comments and they are not shown on actual product</li>
  <li>comments can be useful when working w/ others, or even for yourself</li>
</ul>

<p>examples of comments:</p>
<ul>
  <li>python: # comments are written after the pound sign</li>
  <li>java: 
// comments can be written on a single line using double /
for multiple lines they must be done w /* on both sides of comment</li>
  <li>javascript, c++ have comments similar to java</li>
  <li>HTML uses comments like this: &lt;<em>exclamation mark</em>–comment–&gt;</li>
</ul>
