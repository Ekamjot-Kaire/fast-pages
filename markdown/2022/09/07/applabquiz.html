<p>Person A: Ishi
Person B: Ekam</p>

<h1 id="introduction-page">
<a class="anchor" href="#introduction-page" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Introduction Page</h1>

<ol>
  <li>2 people must be playing this quiz together, Person A and Person B</li>
  <li>Person B must have their screen hidden form Person A and vice versa</li>
  <li>Each Person must take turns to DESCRIBE their image, they can’t directly tell what it is</li>
  <li>Both players need to answer before moving on to the next question</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="questions">
<a class="anchor" href="#questions" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Questions:</h1>

<p>(Person A: me, Person B: Ishi)</p>

<ol>
  <li>Person A has a giraffe on their screen 
Person B has a Toucan on theirs</li>
</ol>

<p>“What animal is on your partner’s screen?”</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Person A has the cover of the song “Royals” by Lorde
Person B has the cover of the song “I Love It” by Icona Pop</p>

    <p>“What song is shown on on your partner’s screen?”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Person A has an image of various colored circles
Person B has an image of differently colored circles</p>

    <p>“What is the color of the largest circle on your partner’s screen?”</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p># General Quiz Plan:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Introduction screen (screen 2):</li>
</ol>

<p>Has a button to start the quiz:
   uses onEvent to set the screen to the next page</p>

<ol>
  <li>Instructions: lists special instructions (since this is a partner quiz)</li>
</ol>

<p>Has another button with onEvent to set screen to first question</p>

<ol>
  <li>Question 1:</li>
</ol>

<p>Three buttons with possible answers. Incorrect Answers lead you to page 6 (“incorrect” screen). Correct answers lead you to page 8 (“correct” screen)</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Question 2: Same mechanic as question 1</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Question 3: Same mechanic as question 1, except correct question takes you to completion page</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Incorrect Page: has a statement that tells the player they answered wrong and a button that takes you back to the introduction screen to start over (later changed)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Completion Page: tells the player they finished the quiz</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Correct Page: lets the player know they answered correct, and are moving on to the next question. It has a button that takes you you to the next question</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h1 id="changes-made">
<a class="anchor" href="#changes-made" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Changes Made:</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Orininally the incorrect page took you to the starting page and the player had to start the quiz over. Then I changed the code by adding adding an on event within the on event of an incorrect question so that the player was taken back to the question they got incorrect</li>
  <li>The original code had a seperate correct page for each question. However eventually I managed to make it so that the same correct page takes the player to the next question.</li>
</ul>
