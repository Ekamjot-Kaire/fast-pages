<ul>
  <li>I originally took this class because I thought coding would be a niche skill that would be usefull in some cases but not that often. I am not planning on taking a career in CS in the future, so I was not that interested in learning code. However, during this meeting I realized that not only can the coding I learn be used in any field, but also the problem solving skills I develop</li>
  <li>I also had been struggling during the first couple weeks in this class. I kept running into problems I didn’t how how to solve, and even when I solved them I was not sure how I did it. However, based on what the alumnis said, I learned CS is not as straightforward as other subjects. And there are answers on the internet for everything I come across, and I just need to have the perseverance and motivation to work through it</li>
  <li>Coding is not just writing predetermined code, but requries creative thinking, and not every solution will be obvious</li>
  <li>Most of the time I will find the best help within my team</li>
  <li>Don’t be discouraged by others doing better, because everyone’s learning curve is different. At the same time, don’t take too much pride in your achievements</li>
</ul>

<p>How did you realize you wanna take your major and how did taking CSA and CSP help?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Hoped to get better at CS</li>
  <li>Loved problem solving</li>
  <li>Started from a young age</li>
  <li>The ability to create new things using code</li>
  <li>Like the complexity and being able to understand computers on another level</li>
  <li>Didn’t necessarily like CS but realized its an important tool that is helpful to learn regardless of what field you are going into</li>
  <li>Helps with web design</li>
</ul>

<p>Biggest challenges in CSP:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The beginning is difficult, but keeping your motivation is important to be able to overcome challenges</li>
  <li>There is an answer somewhere on the internet</li>
  <li>Stay humble, but don’t be discouraged</li>
  <li>Going from high school CS to college CS is a lot different</li>
  <li>Have a specific project to apply what you learn to</li>
  <li>Google has a lot of answers</li>
  <li>Temptation to find short-cuts and cut corners</li>
  <li>There’s not always a rigid structure, things might be a little messy</li>
</ul>

<p>Project Based Learning:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Many CS classes have a project component</li>
  <li>
    <p>In larger (college) classes, teachers don’t have the time to give individual attention – form groups so that you can work through your problems together</p>
  </li>
  <li>There are a lot of repetitive tasks that can made much more efficient using code</li>
  <li>Coding is used everywhere</li>
  <li>A lot of problem solving skills (not necessarily related to coding)</li>
</ul>

<p>Internships:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a resume</li>
  <li>Apply in setp-nov</li>
  <li>Ask small, local companies – their more likely to accept high schoolers</li>
</ul>
