title: Lesson Plan (Section 2)
---

This lesson plan is not fully complete. Unfortunately I'm traveling right now, so I didn't have time to finish it up completely. I'm planning to come up with a more concrete plan as soon as I get home on Wednesday. Sorry about that!

Key vocab:
 - Algorithm (discussed in pt 1)

Objectives: 

- Understand the different types of values that could be stored in variables 
- Understand how the order of steps in an algorithm may change the outcome, and be able to track different variables through a procedure

Ideas for interactive elements:

- Show how changing the order of the steps can change the overall algorithm as a whole
- Send a notebook to everyone, and have them change around the order of the steps themselves
- Ask them what they think the outcome will be, then have everyone test the outcome to see if theyâ€™re correct
- Show them how to track the values assigned to variables as it changes.


Overall Plan: 
1) Discuss different ways variables can be used
2) Discuss and show an example of how changing a procedure can change the result, and how to track the changes 
3) Send a notebook and have everyone test changing steps of a procedure themselves

Ideas for Hacks: 
- Create a flowchart to demonstrate changes to variables (?)
- Tie in with Sreeja's hack of creating flowchart for an algorithm, and have a table with changes...
