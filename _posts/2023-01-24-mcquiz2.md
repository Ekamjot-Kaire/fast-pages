## Missed Questions: 

#### 34) A sorted list of numbers contains 500 elements. Which of the following is closest to the maximum number of list elements that will be examined when performing a binary search for a value in the list?

Correct Answer: 10 
The binary representation of the number 500 is 9 bits. That means only 10 bits are needed to be examined

#### 41) In a certain district, 20 percent of the voters are expected to vote for Candidate A in an election. The computer program below is intended to simulate the result of the election with n voters, and display the number of votes received by Candidate A.

`Line 1: sum <-- 0 
 Line 2: REPEAT n TIMES:
 Line 3: { 
 Line 4:  IF (<MISSING CONDITION>)
 Line 5:    { 
 Line 6:      sum <-- sum + 1
 Line 7:    } 
 Line 8: }
 Line 9: DISPLAY (sum)` 
 
 Correct Answer: I got A correct.. D) `RANDOM (1, 10) <= 2` 
 D is correct because the chance of getting the two numbers that satisfy this condition (1 and 2) is 20%
