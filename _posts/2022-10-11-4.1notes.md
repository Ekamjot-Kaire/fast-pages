at first computers were big and only worked in isolation
- however, as time went on, computers became smaller and smaller
- computing devices like routers were also invented
- however computers were still working alone
- the users of computers needed them to be able to communicate with other devices

- computers communicate with binary, which is combines into "packets"
- computer networks were created for computers to be able to send packets to each other
- a computer network is a group of interconnected computers that send data to each other

Packet Switching: 

- a file/message is sent by being broken up into packets along a path
- the packages can be sent in any order, since they are rearranged back into order by the receiving computer 
- routers are used to "guide" packages to their destination by finding the correct path 

Bandwidth: the max amount of data that can be sent within a certain period of time on a computer network (speed)
- usually measured in bits per second
- the more information there is on a network, the slower it becomes

Why do computers need to communicate? 
- communicating/sharing data makes a lot of tasks easier 

Why are packets used to transmit data? 
- an entire file can't be moved across the internet in one go
- packets are used to send the file in separate pieces 

Vocab: 
- path: sequence of connected computers/computing devices. The path starts at the sender and ends at the receiver
- route: the process of finding a path for the packets to reach the receiver
- computer system: a group of computing devices working together to achieve a goal
- computer device: a device that can run a program (like computers, tablets, servers, routers, etc)
- bandwidth: the maximum amount of data a computer can send at a time
- computer network: interconnected computing devices that can send and receive data from each other
