title: Unit 1.4 - Identifying and Correcting Errors 
---

# Video 1:

4 types of errors: 

<strong> 1) logic error </strong> -- mistake in an algorithm where it behaves in an unintended way <br>
<strong> 2) syntax error </strong> -- mistake where rules of program arent followed 
- this could be a typo, or a missing character/line 
- common examples: forgetting colons, parenthesis/curly or square braces, indentations, quotes.. <br>
<strong> 3) run-time error </strong> -- error that comes up while the program is running <br>
- program starts to run but then crashes and can not finish
- also known as a bug
- may happen because of dividing by 0, inappropriately entered data type (a number instead of a word), or other types <br>
<strong> 4) overflow error </strong>-- error that happens when the computer tries to run a number outside defined range of values 
- because of memory constraints, some numbers are too big for a program to handle (imagine a calculator that has only a 4 digit display -- 100*100 would not be able to be displayed) 

-> errors will always happen when coding no matter what, and should be an expected part of programming <br>
-> good programers can identify what type of error it is and act accordingly

good ways to find and correct errors: 
- test cases 
- hand tracing 
- visualizations
- debuggers
- adding extra output statements

what to do once an error has been found:

-> easiest error to correct is a syntax error -- traceback info states which line the error is happening (though sometimes a little more searching is needed)

-> logic errors are much more difficult -- in this case, test cases are helpful
- test cases: using specific, varying inputs to test whether the input works, and to find where the problem is

grade <-- INPUT("enter a grade")
if (grade > 89) {
    DISPLAY ("A") }
if (grade > 79) {
    DISPLAY ("B") }... etc

good test cases would be numbers within those intervals -- also consider: would decimals work? What about negative numbers?


Hand tracing (most useful for loops): writing out the values of the variables of a loop as the loop iterates
- useful for a loop that repeats a small number of times
- larger loops need a debugging program

Adding extra output statements: 
- used to help find errors
- once the error is corrected, the extra output statements are usually removed
- similar to hand tracing but makes computer do most of the work

If all the above strategies fail:
- visuals and debuggers can sometimes be used
- visualizations: graphs, images, colors (or anything else that can be seen) that can show whether or not the program is working
- debuggers: software designed to test programs -- can be paused in the middle of running to test whether that section is working correctly
