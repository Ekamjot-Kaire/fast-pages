title: Unit 1.4 - Identifying and Correcting Errors 
---

# Video 1:

4 types of errors: 

<strong> 1) logic error </strong> -- mistake in an algorithm where it behaves in an unintended way <br>
<strong> 2) syntax error </strong> -- mistake where rules of program arent followed 
- this could be a typo, or a missing character/line 
- common examples: forgetting colons, parenthesis/curly or square braces, indentations, quotes.. <br>
<strong> 3) run-time error </strong> -- error that comes up while the program is running <br>
- program starts to run but then crashes and can not finish
- also known as a bug
- may happen because of dividing by 0, inappropriately entered data type (a number instead of a word), or other types <br>
<strong> 4) overflow error </strong>-- error that happens when the computer tries to run a number outside defined range of values 
- because of memory constraints, some numbers are too big for a program to handle (imagine a calculator that has only a 4 digit display -- 100*100 would not be able to be displayed) 

-> errors will always happen when coding no matter what, and should be an expected part of programming <br>
-> good programers can identify what type of error it is and act accordingly
