<tr>
<td>1: Program Purpose and Function</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>The video shows the function which is calculating info about a triangle. However, the written response talks about function, not purpose (<strong>College Board score: 0 </strong>)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2: Data Abstraction</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>The student showed code that defines a list, and code that uses the list in a useful way. The name of the list and the purpose is also included (<strong>College Board score: 1 </strong>)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3: Managing Complexity</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>This point was earned because the list organizes triangles into categories, which simplifies the process. The response also describes what would happen if the list was not used, and why it would be less practical (<strong>College Board score: 0 </strong>)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4: Procedural Abstraction</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>The procedure is defined and then used later in the student's code. The student also describes what the procedure is doing (<strong>College Board score: 1 </strong>)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>5: Algorithm Implementation</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>Response 3c describes how the algorithm includes sequencing, iteration, and selection (<strong>College Board score: 1 </strong>)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>6: Testing</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>The student describes what inputs are being added, why those specific inputs were chosen and what they are meant to test, and the outputs (<strong>College Board score: 1 </strong>)</td>

<li>Row 3: I gave the student a 1, while College Board gave them a 0. This is because the list was not necessary for the program, and the explanation given for what would be done without the list is incomplete </li>

<tr>
<td>1: Program Purpose and Function</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>The student included both the function and the purpose of the game that they made. They also wrote specific inputs that must be given to achieve certain outputs (<strong>College Board score: 1 </strong>)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2: Data Abstraction</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>The student included both the list and comments with the purpose of the list. The name and what the list contains also is written (<strong>College Board score: 1 </strong>)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3: Managing Complexity</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>The student mentions how there are 10,800 items to be kept track of, which would be practically impossible to do without a list.  (<strong>College Board score: 1 </strong>)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4: Procedural Abstraction</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>A procedure is shown being defined, and the response shows all the times it is called. The student also writes what the procedure does</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>5: Algorithm Implementation</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>Sequencing , iteration, and selection are shown in the algorithm, and fully explained in the response</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>6: Testing</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>Two different sets of inputs are given, and the conditions that those inputs are testing is specified</td>

<li>Pay special attention to the differences between program and purpose</li>
<li>The function of everything (lists, procedures, algorithms) have to be written out </li>
<li>The list included in the written response has to be completely necessary</li>
