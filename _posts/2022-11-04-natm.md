# The Different Classes:

I visited all the classes, including 3D animation, ceramics, studio art, and drawing and painting. It was inspiring seeing how talented all of the students were. Some of the art pieces even seemed exactly like something you would see at an actual museum gallery. One particular painting that I liked was this one from Jennifer Lee.

I liked how creative this painting was. The anatomy and colors were also very interesting, and it felt like the artist had a lot of experience.

I also saw a lot of interesting pieces in the ceramics section. I liked how the one on the right has a snake.

I also looked at some of the projects of other teams in our class. One project I thought was interesting was a group who made a game of hangman. 

# Project Ideas for Next Tri:

Our project seemed to have a lot more backend than frontend. So for our next project, it might be better to do something more like a game, since that would have more of a balance between backend and frontend. 

For time management, it might be helpful to test new ideas at home, and then come to school with any issues that showed up, so that the whole team can work through it together
