# Video 1: 

--> Starting the development of a program:

- it starts w/ an idea
- you need to have a specific purpose in mind when creating the program -- what do you want the program to accomplish? 

(sometimes development changes based on what happens during the process (whether good or bad)

--> Developers then start investigating the problem/purpose:
- set requirements for what the program must do 
- find and understand constraints (lack of tools, time...)
- understand interests of user 

ways of investigating include surveys, user testing, observations, interviews


--> After investigation: 
developers begin brainstroming: 
- draw a storyboard 
- planning user experience 
- lay out user interface (how will the user interact w/ the program)
- organizing/dividing work
- find a way to test the program 

--> Program requirements -- how should the program behave?: 
- list of users interactions so that they know what they can actually do w/ the program
- create prototype of program -- an incremental process is usually used to test/refine small parts to make sure they work before putting everything together 

--> Testing:
- testing must happen at every step of the way 
- Testing must happen at the 
        - micro level: make sure each part works as its supposed to 
        - macro: do all the individual parts interact correctly?
- refine and revise 


# Video 2:

- Program development is rarely done alone; instead there are usually teams of ppl (some teams include a few ppl while others could include hundreds)
-  usually there are multiple people/teams that work on individual components 
- everyone must get credit for their work -- their names have to written in the documentation of the program 
- make sure to credit partners
- for some languages you also use comments within the program to give credit -- w/ comments, development teams can find out who can/should fix a problem that shows up

- many times developers use code segments, algorithms, and procedures done by others -- if someone already invented it you don't have to develop the same thing again
- however, even if they are not part of your team you must credit them: include authors name and source of any code used 
- sort of like a works cited 

# Video 3: 

programers use somethign called program documentation to:
- describe overall program 
- list specific functions of program
- describe specific functions or code segments of program 
- list events and outputs
- how others can interact with program 
- list contributers and other developers of program  

documentation happens: 
- at the beginning: list specifications
- while programming to keep track of progress and issues 
- after to explain the overall process

good documentation can improve: 
- efficiency 
-  ability to fix issues/refine the program 
- response to bugs 

how to programmers document while programing:
- most languages allow comments 
- comments are txt written within the program that are not executed and don't affect the program 
- they are only for developers; computers skip over comments and they are not shown on actual product 
- comments can be useful when working w/ others, or even for yourself 


examples of comments: 
- python: # comments are written after the pound sign 
- java: 
// comments can be written on a single line using double /
for multiple lines they must be done w /* on both sides of comment
-  javascript, c++ have comments similar to java 
- HTML uses comments like this: <*exclamation mark*--comment-->
