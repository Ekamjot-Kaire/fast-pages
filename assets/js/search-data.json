            "content": "Student . Mrs. Paulson . HSE 3: Period 3 . 28 September 2021 . How Happiness Happens . The word “happy” is such a simple word, yet people spend their life yearning for this feeling. The documentary Happy, utilizes several stories from some of the most happy people on the planet. Even though most of the people in the film aren’t the most wealthy, they are still shown being content with their life’s. Spending time with loved ones and being in nature are two of the most important contributing factors to happiness. . Many of the people in the film were usually surrounded by loved ones, usually contributing to their high levels of happiness. Manoj Singh, a rickshaw driver in the heart of India, shows how he is continuously happy. Surprisingly, Singh is very content with his life, even though he doesn’t have the most glamorous home or job he still manages to find happiness in his life. The reason Singh is so upbeat is that he is surrounded by loved ones. Singh has the opportunity to be close with his immediate family, but also have a strong personal connection with the other people living in his village. It is important to be surrounded by loved ones because Singh looks forward to returning from his strenuous labor. Just like Singh, I am also lucky to be able to connect and constantly be around the people I love. Even though high school can be very tough and challenging, I still find myself waking up in the morning excited to go to school; not due to the algebra quiz after lunch, but because I have numerous friends that are willing to take on the high school challenges with me. My friends and family can bring me up if I am experiencing a rough day, for example when I was studying for finals this past semester, my parents helped me by quizzing me on my long list of vocab for my AP European History class. These small gestures of love are why having a great support group around you can really make you feel special and worth something. . The place where you live or frequently go can also create happiness. From the film Happy, Roy Blanchard Sr. showed what made him calm and comfortable. Blanchard lived in the bayou in Louisiana and usually made daily boat trips around the swampy waters. He also fished and harvested crabs from his traps, and showed his passion for living off the land around him. Blanchard shared his catch with his relatives and friends for weekly cookouts, which made for many unforgettable moments for Blanchard and his family. I too find tranquility in nature because I enjoy camping in the Rocky Mountains during the summer. In Colorado we are so lucky to have the mountains to our west as our own personal playground. I find happiness in camping in the wilderness because it relieves me of any stresses or burdens I may be carrying. Exploring outdoors is such a unique experience because there is always something new to be discovered. Finding happiness can seem like an endless mountain, and that the peak will never be found, however there are many methods and changes we can make to our lives to make us more content with the beautiful world we live in. .",

            "content": "Alumni Panel Notes . Takeaways: . I originally took this class because I thought coding would be a niche skill that would be usefull in some cases but not that often. I am not planning on taking a career in CS in the future, so I was not that interested in learning code. However, during this meeting I realized that not only can the coding I learn be used in any field, but also the problem solving skills I develop | I also had been struggling during the first couple weeks in this class. I kept running into problems I didn’t how how to solve, and even when I solved them I was not sure how I did it. However, based on what the alumnis said, I learned CS is not as straightforward as other subjects. And there are answers on the internet for everything I come across, and I just need to have the perseverance and motivation to work through it | Coding is not just writing predetermined code, but requries creative thinking, and not every solution will be obvious | Most of the time I will find the best help within my team | Don’t be discouraged by others doing better, because everyone’s learning curve is different. At the same time, don’t take too much pride in your achievements | . Notes I took during the meeting: . How did you realize you wanna take your major and how did taking CSA and CSP help? . Hoped to get better at CS | Loved problem solving | Started from a young age | The ability to create new things using code | Like the complexity and being able to understand computers on another level | Didn’t necessarily like CS but realized its an important tool that is helpful to learn regardless of what field you are going into | Helps with web design | . Biggest challenges in CSP: . The beginning is difficult, but keeping your motivation is important to be able to overcome challenges | There is an answer somewhere on the internet | Stay humble, but don’t be discouraged | Going from high school CS to college CS is a lot different | Have a specific project to apply what you learn to | Google has a lot of answers | Temptation to find short-cuts and cut corners | There’s not always a rigid structure, things might be a little messy | . Project Based Learning: . Many CS classes have a project component | In larger (college) classes, teachers don’t have the time to give individual attention – form groups so that you can work through your problems together . | There are a lot of repetitive tasks that can made much more efficient using code | Coding is used everywhere | A lot of problem solving skills (not necessarily related to coding) | . Internships: . Have a resume | Apply in setp-nov | Ask small, local companies – their more likely to accept high schoolers | .",
