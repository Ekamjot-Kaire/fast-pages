            "content": "Variables . Variables are an abstraction inside a program that can hold a value | It organizes data by labeling it with a descriptive name | It consists of three parts: name, value, and type | Using meaningful variables names helps with readability of program code and understanding of what values are represented by the variables | . Naming Variables . Do&#39;s Don&#39;ts Why . highScore | highestScoreInTheGame | Keep it simple and easy to read, having variables that are too complicated can cause your code to become messy and unreadable | . highScore | highscore | Differentiate the words in your variable with a capital letter. Makes things easier to read | . firstName | n | not specific enough/vague | . isRaining | is it raining | spaces are improper syntax | . phoneNumber | 555-number | dashes are improper syntax and numbers should be avoided in variable names | .

A list of data can also be stored in variables. Why is that useful? . print/retrieve specific values in the list without creating a lot of variables | easily remove/add/change items into the list | . colors = [&quot;red&quot;, &quot;orange&quot;, &quot;yellow&quot;] print(colors[2]) . yellow . Assignments . The assignment operator allows a program to change the value represented by a variable | Used to assigning values to variables | . Operator Description Syntax Outcome when print(a) . = | Assign value of right side of expression to left side operand | a = b | b | . += | Add right side operand with left side operand and then assign to left operand | a += b | a + b | . -= | Subtract right operand from left operand and then assign to left operand: True if both operands are equal | a -= b | a - b | . *= | Multiply right operand with left operand and then assign to left operand | a *= b | a * b | . /= | Divide left operand with right operand and then assign to left operand | a /= b | a / b | . **= | Calculate exponent(raise power) value using operands and assign value to left operand | a **= b | a ^ b | . a = 1 b = 2 a = b print(a) .

Method used in coding to represent data in a useful form, by taking away aspects of data that aren&#39;t being used in the situation | Variables and lists are primary tools in data abstraction | Provides a separation between the abstract properties of a data type and the concrete details of its representation | . Lists &amp; Strings . List = ordered sequence of elements | Element = individual value in a list that is assigned to a unique index | Index = a way to reference the elements in a list or string using natural numbers; each element of a string is referenced by an index | String = ordered sequence of characters (Letters, numbers, special characters) . Note: index starts at 1 for AP Exam, must be whole numbers, cannot be negative, and goes up to the number of elements in the list We can represent a list or string using a variable . | . Example of a List - Colors . Index Element . 1 | Green | . 2 | Blue | . 3 | Purple | . 4 | Pink | . At Index 1, the element is green, at index 2, the element is blue, etc. | . Managing the Complexity of a Program through Data Abstraction . Data abstractions help manage complexity in programs by giving a collection of data a name without referencing the specific details of the representation | Developing a data abstraction to use in a program can result in a program that is easier to develop and maintain | . colors = [&quot;green&quot;, &quot;red&quot;, &quot;pink&quot;, &quot;purple&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;, &quot;brown&quot;] for x in colors: print(x) . Using Lists as Data Abstractions . What are Lists? . Allow for data abstraction | Bundle variables together | Store multiple elements | Allows multiple related items to be treated as a single value | Give one name to a set of memory cells | Can keep adding elements to it as needed | Can store elements as a single variable by using a list | . 3 Types of List Operations . Assigning values to a list at certain indices | Creating an empty list and assigning it to a variable | Assigning a copy of one list to another list (setting one list equal to another list) | 1. Assigning values to a list at certain indices . colorsList=[&quot;pink&quot;, &quot;yellow&quot;, &quot;green&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;, &quot;orange&quot;] print(colorsList) . [&#39;pink&#39;, &#39;yellow&#39;, &#39;green&#39;, &#39;blue&#39;, &#39;orange&#39;] . 2. Creating an empty list and assigning it to a variable . colorsList=[] # can be used if you want to create a list that can be filled with values later . 3. Assigning a copy of one list to another list (setting one list equal to another list) . # copy of the list is made; the list isn&#39;t sorted in place def Reverse(lst): # defining variable: lst new_lst = lst[::-1] return new_lst lst = [&quot;pink&quot;, &quot;green&quot;, &quot;purple&quot;, &quot;yellow&quot;, &quot;orange&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;, &quot;black&quot;] print(Reverse(lst)) # reverse 1st .

Improving code readability | Reducing the need for new variables as more data is collected | Can easily update data | Can easily convert data to different forms | . How do Lists Help Manage the Complexity of a Program? . Don’t need as many variables | Can easily change the number of variables | Can apply the same mathematical computation (through an algorithm) to all the elements in the list | . Data Abstraction Practice . Manage the complexity of the given code below using a list. Re-write the code segment in a less complex way, but with the same result. . color1=&quot;green&quot; color2=&quot;red&quot; color3=&quot;pink&quot; color4=&quot;purple&quot; color5=&quot;blue&quot; color6=&quot;brown&quot; print(color1) print(color2) print(color3) print(color4) print(color5) print(color6) . green red pink purple blue brown .

[&#39;green&#39;, &#39;red&#39;, &#39;pink&#39;, &#39;purple&#39;, &#39;blue&#39;, &#39;brown&#39;] . AP Exam Use of Data Abstraction . With the properties of the AP Exam pseudocode, lists work differently from what we&#39;ve learned in python so far, here are the two major differences: . The index does not start at 0 but 1 | There is only one method of interchanging data between lists, and that is completely overwriting previous list data with the other list n&quot;, | . Homework . You will turn in a program that utilizes lists and variables as it&#39;s primary function, options could be a quiz, a sorter, database, or wherever your imagination brings you. You will be graded on how well you understood the concepts and if you used anything other than just the simplest parts . Quiz template, if you do use it, fix the issues, and add more to it than it&#39;s current barebones state. I would recommend using it to create something related to school. . print(&quot;Hello.

            "content": "Class and Object Terms . The foundations of Object-Oriented Programming is defining a Class . In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint for creating an Object. (a data structure). An Object is used like many other Python variables. | A Class has ... a collection of data, these are called Attributes and in Python are pre-fixed using the keyword self | a collection of Functions/Procedures. These are called *Methods when they exist inside a Class definition. | . | An Object is created from the Class/Template. Characteristics of objects ... an Object is an Instance of the Class/Template | there can be many Objects created from the same Class | each Object contains its own Instance Data | the data is setup by the Constructor, this is the &quot;init&quot; method in a Python class | all methods in the Class/Template become part of the Object, methods are accessed using dot notation (object.method()) | . | A Python Class allow for the definition of @ decorators, these allow access to instance data without the use of functions ... @property decorator (aka getter). This enables developers to reference/get instance data in a shorthand fashion (object.name versus object.get_name()) | @name.setter decorator (aka setter). This enables developers to update/set instance data in a shorthand fashion (object.name = &quot;John&quot; versus object.set_name(&quot;John&quot;)) | observe all instance data (self._name, self.email ...) are prefixed with &quot;&quot;, this convention allows setters and getters to work with more natural variable name (name, email ...) | . | .

Purpose: . The purpose of this lesson is to help students understand how to make an efficient program and optimize it and understand its importance to the CSP curriculum. . What is Algorithmic Efficiency? . The ability of an algorithm to solve a problem in an efficient way An efficient algorithm solves a problem quickly and with a minimum amount of resources, such as time and memory. | . | How do we determine if an algorithm is efficient or not? One way we can do this is by determining the time complexity of the algorithm. | Another way is through space complexity. | . | . Traveling Merchant Problem Hacks: .

Purpose: . The purpose of this lesson is to introduce students to the concept of undecidable problems in computer science and to explain why these problems are important. . Key vocabulary: . Decision problem | Decidable problem | Undecidable problem | . Decision Problem . A decision problem is a problem in computer science and mathematics that can be solved by a yes-no answer, also known as a binary answer. In other words, a decision problem is a problem for which there are only two possible outputs:&quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;. There are two types of decision problems that Collegeboard goes over: . Decidable Problems | Undecidable Problems | . A decidable is a problem in computer science and mathematics for which an algorithm can be created that can always produce a correct answer or solution. In other words, a decidable problem is a problem for which there exists an algorithm that can be used to determine whether a given input is a valid solution or not. . An undecidable problem is a problem in computer science and mathematics for which it is impossible to create an algorithm that can always provide a correct answer or solution. This means that it is not possible for an algorithm to always determine whether a given input is a valid solution to an undecidable problem. . Decidable Problems . A decidable problem is an algorithm that can always have an output of yes or no given any input. It is always correct. . Example of a Decidable Problem . The procedure below tests to see if a number is divisible by 13. If it is, it returns true. If it isn&#39;t, it returns false. . def divideThirteen(number): if number % 13 == 0: return True else: return False print(divideThirteen(26)) print(divideThirteen(30)) . True False . Undecidable Problems . An Example of a Forever Running Code . The code keeps adding 1 to the variable number until number is no longer an integer(This is not the python data type &quot;integer&quot;, it&#39;s the integer in number theory). However, there is no end to this code, making the computer run forever. There is no halt to the code. . i = 0 number = 1 def integerTest(n): # Testing if the number is an integer if n%1 ==0: return True else: return False # Using while loop to keep searching an a non-integer above 1. Note that the computer runs forever. while i == 0: number += 1 if integerTest(number) == False: i +=1 print(&quot;Done&quot;) .

The Halting Problem . The halting problem is an example of an undecidable. It states that it is not always possible to correctly determine whether a code halts or runs forever. . There is no way to write an algorithm to analyze and determine whether a body of code can run forever or not. . Halting Problem Example: . In order to understand this, suppose that an algorithm was able to analyze whether a code halts or not. Let&#39;s call this algorithm HaltChecker. | HaltChecker analyzes the program,program P, and its input,input I. If program P halts with input I, HaltChecker returns an output of &quot;halts&quot;. If program P doesn&#39;t halt(runs forever) with input I, HaltChecker returns an output of &quot;never&quot;. For example, in the code where it tests if variable number, the code runs forever, so HaltChecker returns an output of &#39;never&#39;. | Then, we add another algorithm called Reverser which reverses HaltChecker&#39;s output. So, if &quot;never&quot; is the output of HaltChecker, then the output of Reverser is &#39;halts&#39;. It&#39;s also the same the other way around: if HaltChecker has an output of &quot;halts&quot;, then Reverser has an output of &#39;never&#39;. | We combine these algorithms into one entire body of code. | Since Reverser is the algorithm at the end, hence giving the ultimate output, notice how it prints &quot;never&quot; when in fact there is an end(As proved by HaltChecker), and how it also prints &quot;halts&quot; when there is in fact is no end to the code(Also proved by HaltChecker). As a result, HaltChecker is inaccurate and this is an undecidable problem. | . This Diagram Sums up the Entire Process in the Bulleted List: . Credits of diagram and example to Khan Academy . FAQ . Q: If Reverser is causing the problem, why not remove it? | A: Removing Reverser will remove the problems, however, we are looking for ways which create the problem of not outputting a correct result. One example is enough to prove that it is an undecidable problem since it proves that the code is not completely accurate. | . Extra Things to Notice . Note that while a computer may take a long time to run a section of code, it does not mean that the computer is going to run forever. | Humans are able to solve some undecidable problems. The entire Halting Problem example was to prove that computers cannot solve undecidable problems. | . Hacks . Come up with one situation in which a computer runs into an undecidable problem. Explain why it is considered an undecidable problem. . One example of an unsolvable problem would be determining how many prime numbers exist. This is because there are an infinite number of prime numbers, so in an ideal situation the algorithm would continue to search for prime numbers forever. However, more realistically, the computer would likely crash after having to store a large amount of numbers. . 3.17 Homework . Your homework for Algorithmic Efficiency is pretty simple. .

You can use math or whatever else you would like to do. | Write code to get the computer to run forever. Check this example if you need help, but please come up with your own idea. | Homeworks, hacks, and classwork(filled in blanks) for both 3.17 and 3.18 are due on Thursday at 9:00 pm. -0.1 points for each day late. . Solvable problem: . This algorithm finds all numbers that are divisible by 3 in a given list, and places it in a new list. This is decidable, because a number is either divisible by 3, or not, and the computer has the ability to find these numbers. . divisible_by = 3 numbers = [4, 78, 15, 80, 27] divisible_numbers = [] for n in numbers: if n % divisible_by == 0: divisible_numbers.append(n) print(divisible_numbers) . [78, 15, 27] . Unsolvable problem: . This problem is unsolvable, because any number chosen (that is not equal to 0) will never be equal 0 no matter how many times it is divided by any number. Therefore, the algorithm will loop forever (unless I stop it or my computer crashes). . num = 8 divider = 0.0008 while num != 0: num = num/divider print(num) . 10000.0 12500000.0 15625000000.0

            "content": "First Order of Business: Get your notebook . Open a terminal in vscode, run command: cd _notebooks, type &#39;wget&#39; and paste this link into said terminal and run it . | Take notes wherever you please, but you will be graded on participating . | . So, what is a simulation anyway? . A simulation is a tested scenario used for viewing results/outputs to prepare for them in real world situations . | These can be used for games like dice rolling, spinners, etc . | These can be used for practical things such as building structures, testing car crashes, and other things before engaging in them in the real world . | These simulations can have the option of obeying real world physics (Gravity, collision) or they can go against these norms since this is a fictitious scenario, and couldn&#39;t happen in real life . | . Notes: . real world physics don&#39;t have to apply in simulations, but can be visualized if needed | allows people to test what would happen without causing damage | . Big Question . Which of the following simulations could be the LEAST useful? . | A retailer trying to identify which products sold the most . | A restaurant determining the efficiency of robots | An insurance company studying the rain impact of cars | A sports bike company studying design changes to their new bike design | . If you guessed a bike company, you&#39;re wrong, because the retail simulation was the right answer. Simulating robots in food service, studying rain impact on vehicles, and new bike design can contribute a lot more to society in comparison to seeing what products sell more than others. | . Notes: . retail simulation is more niche??? | therefore not as useful | more difficult to simulate a sail | . Next Big Question . If you were making a simulation for making a new train station, which of the following would be true about this simulation? . It could reveal potential problems/safety issues before construction starts | It cannot be used to test the train station in different weather | Simulation will add high costs to projects | Simulation is not needed because this train station already exists | . Potential Safety was the right answer, because you need somewhere to test the safety and ethnics of what you&#39;re about to do before you start building it. Otherwise, let&#39;s just say you&#39;ll have a special plaque for FBI&#39;s Most Wanted | . Simulation 1: . Both programs below do the same thing. Given a height and a weight, they calculate how long it will take for a object to fall to the ground in a vacuum subjected to normal Earth levels of gravity. . However, the second one is a simulation. It calculates the distance the object has fallen every 0.1 seconds. This is useful for if you wanted a visual representation of a falling object, which pure math can&#39;t do as smoothly. . height = float(input(&quot;height in meters?&quot;)) weight = input(&quot;weight in pounds?&quot;) stuff = (2 * (height / 9.8))**(1/2) print(&quot;It will take&quot;, stuff,&quot;seconds for an object that weighs&quot;,weight,&quot;pounds&quot;,&quot;to fall &quot;,height,&quot;meters in a vacuum&quot;) . It will take 1.1693361102674928 seconds for an object that weighs 45 pounds to fall 6.7 meters in a vacuum . t = 0 g = 0 d = 0 false = True while false: t = t + 0.1 d = 9.8 / 2 * (t**2) if d &gt;= height: false = False #print(d) # if you want to print the distance every time it calculates it. Too long to output to a terminal, but this could be useful to display graphically. #print(t) print(t) print(d) . 1.2 7.056 . Simulation 2: . This simulation is made in order to simulate movement on a 2d plane vs a 3d plane. . | How it works: we have multiple variables, if statements and equations under a while command in order to randomy generate steps on a 2d plane.

Simulations in the wild . Simulations are used extremely frequently in real life applications. One of the most common examples of simulations are video games.

Blender is made up of many small simulations, but one big one it uses is simulating the way light bounces off of and interacts with objects. . HW !!! . Create a simulation. It can be anything, just has to simulate something. . Some ideas: . Two objects colliding | Gravity on other planets | . AND .

            "content": "Calling Procedures . Slide 1: . A procedure is a named group of programming instructions that may have parameters and return values. | Procedures are referred to by different names, such as method or function , depending on the programing language. | Parameters are input values of a procedure. Arguments specify the values of the parameters when procedure is called. | A procedure call interrupts the sequencial execution of statements causing the program to execute the statements within the procedure before continuing. One the last statement in the procedure (or a return statement) has executed, flow or control is returned to the point immediately following where the procedure was called. | . Slide 2: . When calling procedures, it&#39;s important to take notice to whether it returns data, or a block of statements . | If the procedure just returns a block of statements, you call the procedure by referring to the procedure name, and inputting the arguments. | If the procedure returns some sort of data like a boolean or value , then you will assign that value to a variable | . Slide 3: . Assume the Temperature outside is Fahrenheit. | The procedure convertFahrenheit is intended to convert from Fahrenheit to Celsius. | Convert the following psuedo code to python | . def convertFahrenheit(): # code goes here return celsius convertFahrenheit(outsideTemp) . Conversion: . def convertFarenheit(temp): celsius = temp - 32 celsius = celsius * 5/9 return celsius print(&quot;what is the temperature outside?&quot;) outsideTemp = input() outsideTemp = (convertFarenheit(int(outsideTemp))) print(outsideTemp) . what is the temperature outside? 7.222222222222222 . Developing Procedures . Slide 8: . Picking a descriptive name is important in case you revisit the code later on (separate words with capitals) There are 2 different types of procedures- ones that return a value and those that simply execute a block of statements Steps of developing procedure: picking a useful name, thinking of parameters (what data does the procedure need to know), making a flowchart or writing procedure in pseudocode, and actually developing the procedure. . Slide 9: . In this example, a teacher is writing a program that will replace the grade on a previous quiz if the new grade is better than the previous. .

What was the overall grade What was the quiz grade? 167.5 None . Procedural Abstraction . One type of abstraction is procedural abstraction which provides a name for a process and allows a procedure to be used only knowing what it does and not how it does it | This is very helpful in managing complexity in a program | Subdivision of a program into separate subprograms is called modulatiry | A procedural abstraction may extract shared features to generalize functionality instead of duplicating code. This allows for program reuse, which helps manage complexity | When a pre-written procedure is called, you don’t necessarily need to know the details of this, just what it does and how to call it | Simply, procedural abstraction is naming and calling a pre-written procedure | Making sure to include the right arguments so the procedure can do what its supposed to do is crucial | . Complexity Example . One of the biggest advantages of procedural abstraction is managing complexity. . Think about the process of simplifying the code? What do you think the advantage of the code segment on the left is? . Code Segment 1 Code Segment 2 . ROTATE_LEFT() | detourLeft() | .

The lesson will start off with introducing what algorithms are and what they do, moreover, what their significance is. . 3.9 Lesson 1 has the objective to teach the student of the outcome of similar algorithmic concepts and similar algorithms. In this lesson, you will see different ways on how algorithms are developed. . Lesson 1 | Defining Algorithms . What is an algorithm? An algorithm is a process or set of rules to be followed through CODE. There are set limitations, this is what makes algorithms fun, you can your imagination and create whatever you wan with your own instructions! . Algorithms can be written in different ways and still accomplish the same tasks . | Algorithms that appear similar can yield different side effects or results. . | Some conditional statements can be written as the same as Boolean expressions (VICE VERSA) . | Different algorithms can be developed or use to solve the same problem. . | . Example 1 | What happens if we test the algorithm with different outputs? . The pseudocode above is translated to python for you. . Record what your outputs are when you enter 95 degrees F, does the algorithm yield the same result? . The conditional below is nested . temp = int(input(&quot;Select a temperature from 0 to 99 degrees F&quot;)) if (temp &gt;= 90): print(&quot;It&#39;s too hot outside!&quot;) else: if (temp &gt;= 65): print(&quot;Sure I will play outside!&quot;) else: print(&quot;It is too cold outside!&quot;) # Input 54 and then 95, what do you notice? . It&#39;s too hot outside! . temp = int(input(&quot;Select a temperature from 0 to 99 degrees F&quot;)) if (temp &gt;= 90): print(&quot;It&#39;s too hot outside!&quot;) if (temp &gt;= 65): print(&quot;Sure I will play outside!&quot;) if (temp &lt; 65): print(&quot;It is too cold outside!&quot;) # Input 54 and then Input 95, what do you notice? . It is too cold outside! . NOW RECORD with another output . Record what your outputs are when you enter 54, does the algorithm yield the same result this time? . *Now use 95 as an input for the two code blocks above. . Even though an algorithm&#39;s code can look the same, you have to be careful, they can always yield different results. When constructing algorithms you want to make sure that your code corresponds with what you want as your output. You set the limit of your code and you decide what the code&#39;s output is. . Conditionals vs. Booleans . The condition and instructions are what differ, that&#39;s where the magic happens. The condition is a boolean expression when an expression outputs either true or false. Boolean values are another type of data type in programming languages, and they can only ever hold true or false. . Exercise . Learning how to utilize conditionals and booleans are important for developing algorithms. Use this exercise to help you. . Can either Boolean expression on the right replace the conditional on the left? Assume isWeekday and isHoliday are Boolean variables. . *NOTE = you can edit the variables to check the conditions needed! . IsHoliday = False IsWeekday = True if IsHoliday: driveWork = True else: if IsWeekday: driveWork = True else: driveWork = False print(driveWork) . True . Logically thinking about conditionals and booleans . Now the problem may seem confusing, but the best way to develop an algorithm is to think about all the possible results that can be potentially be outputted. . So if IsHoliday is set to true, then driveWork is automatically equal to false and it does not matter what value of isWeekday is. This must mean that one of the conditionals must be NOT IsHoliday. . In the case that lets say IsHoliday is set to false, then the variable for weekday needs to be checked. If it&#39;s true then driveWork is true, if it&#39;s false then driveWork is false. This must mean that the other conditional isWeekday. . Combining both conditionals, you get option 2, which is not IsHoliday and IsWeekday. This is why option 2 is right! . Example 3 | Conditionals vs Booleans . The following algorithms are intended to sum the odd numbers from 1-9. Which algorithms work as intended? . Below, I have translated the block code into python, import this to your jupyter notebook and record the result. What do you notice? . First block . sum = 1 counter = 3 #iteration var = 0 while (var &lt; 4): #while the var is &lt;= 4, it executes those commands, once it exceeds it hits the else command sum = sum + counter counter = counter + 2 var = var + 1 # now go through the whole thing 4 times, this is an iteration, a vital part of algorithms. else: print(sum) . 25 . Second block . sum = 0 counter = 9 #iteration while (counter &gt;= 1): sum = sum + counter counter = counter - 2 print(sum) . 25 . When we start our initializing left sum as 1 counter as 3 we had no iterations yet. Remember we&#39;re going to have to repeat this four times because the block code prompts us to repeat 4 times, so we iterate. So as we go through and follow what the block gives us. . So you see that the sum does work, it does sum up the odd numbers from 1-9 . Now lets look at the right block. . Sum is set to 0 Counter is set to 9 We must repeat until the counter &lt; 1 is true. . So we keep adding until -1, that is when the counter &lt; 1 is true, so we stop . So why is it important to understand that algorithms can be written in different ways and still accomplish the same task? . An algorithm is beautiful that way, just because you think of solving a problem differently, doesn&#39;t mean your wrong, . 3.9 Part 2 . Flowcharts . Flowcharts can help you visualize the functionality of an algorithm . | They are a good way to double check whether or not your algorithm is achieving its purpose . | . How To Set Up A Flowchart . label the start point . | Define any and all variables you may need . | Consider the first question you want the algorithm to ask . | Write what you want the algorithm to do if the answer to that question is yes (or true) . | Write what you want the algorithm to do if the answer to that question is no (or false) . Steps 3-5 are the steps to creating code that uses a process called selection (you can convert the question from step 3 to a conditional if-statement in code) | . | Write out all necessary steps for the algorithm to function properly . | You may want your algorithm to iterate some steps until a condition is met . You can write the steps that need to be repeated, then draw an arrow from the last step to a step above that contains a conditional statement | . | determine a way to reach the end goal | Selection vs. Iteration . Selection: . A process used in algorithms where a conditional if-statement leads to one of two outcomes . Outcome 1: if the conditional statement is true, something will happen . | Outcome 2: if the conditional statement is false, something else will happen . | Ex: see Example A . | . | . | Iteration . A process used in algorithms that allows certain things to happen until a condition is satisfied . Once the condition is satisfied, then an outcome is produced . | This can take the form of a for-loop, while-loop, and/or if-statement . | . | . | . Example A . Consider this situation: . You are shopping for your favorite food at your favorite supermarket . | You see that there is a sale on wheat products for 35% off . | There is another sale on produce for 20% off . | These sales are mutually exclusive . | Tax on all items is 8% . | . | Your TASK: .

Goals/Objectives: . detirmine number of iterations required to find vlue in data set. | explain requirements for binary search | . What is Binary Search? . Binary search is a search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array. Binary search compares the target value to the middle element of the array. | An algorithm for iterating to find a value inside a data set | . About Binary Search: . Binary Search Algorithm starts in the middle of a data set of numbers and eliminates half the data. This process reapeats until the desired value is found or until all elements have been eliminated. | In order to use binary search effectivly and properly, data must be stored in order | COLLEGE BOARD INDEX STARTS AT 1 NOT 0 | . Think about how you would you would try to find a certain number in this set. . (IMAGE HERE) . One way would be to line up the numbers and count them individually untill you find the desired value. . When working with large data sets with lots of numbers, methods like these wont work . Instead, a Binary Search would be more effective. | . (IMAGE HERE) . Here we can see the numbers are set in an increasing order. Setting numbers in an increasing or decreasing is needed for a binary search . Binary search is started with the middle number first Middle number is found by taking the higest index number plus the lowest and divided by two | . | Binary Search can be represented using a tree as shown below | . (IMAGE HERE) . . Heres an easy way to put it: . binary search fidns the desired element by continuously chopping the search area in half | say the element you are looking for is &#39;f&#39; | . [a b c d e f g h] . We would start in the middle at element &#39;d&#39; | becuase our target is greater than d we will eliminate everything left of &#39;d&#39; including &#39;d&#39; (chopping it in half) . [e f g h] is what now remains . again we would &#39;chop in half&#39; | say we iterate through &#39;g&#39; and &#39;h&#39;, our desired element is still not found so we would eliminate &#39;g; and &#39;h&#39; and continue the process | . [e f] . now we are down to 2 elements | &#39;chopping in half&#39; will give us our desired element | . [f] . | . def BinarySearch(array, x, low, high): # Repeat until the pointers low and high meet each other while low &lt;= high: mid = low + (high - low)//2 # find the middle (taking the higest index number plus the lowest and divided by two) if array[mid] == x: # if desired number is the middle is found return desired number (middle number) return mid elif array[mid] &lt; x: low = mid + 1 else: high = mid - 1 return -1 array = [6, 19, 22, 56, 65, 78, 82] x = 65 result = BinarySearch(array, x, 0, len(array)-1) if result != -1: print(&quot;Element is present at index &quot; + str(result)) else: print(&quot;Not found&quot;) . Element is present at index 4 . We have created a function called binary_search() function which takes two arguments - a list to be sorted and a number to be searched. . | We have declared two variables to store the lowest and highest values in the list. The lowest is assigned initial value to 0, the highest to len(list1) 1 and mid as 0. . | Next, we have declared the while loop with the condition that the lowest is equal and smaller than the highest. The while loop will iterate if the number has not been found yet. . | In the while loop, we find the mid value and compare the index value to the number we are searching for. . | If the value of the mid-index is smaller than n, we increase the mid value by 1 and assign it to the low. The search moves to the left side. . | Otherwise, if the value of mid index is larger than n, we decrease the mid value by 1 and assign it to the high. The search moves to the right side. . | If the n is equal to the mid value then return mid. . | This will happen until the low is equal and smaller than the high. . | If we reach at the end of the function, then the element is not present in the list. We return -1 to the calling function. . | . . Hacks . Using my example above and steps below, create your own iteration using binary search . Steps . Compare x with the middle element. | If x matches with the middle element, we return the mid index. | Else if x is greater than the mid element, then x can only lie in the right (greater) half subarray after the mid element. Then we apply the algorithm again for the right half. | Else if x is smaller, the target x must lie in the left (lower) half. So we apply the algorithm for the left half. | .

Coding all of these individually takes a lot of unnecessary time, how can we shorten this time? . Iteration . Iteration is the repetition of a process or utterance applied to the result or taken from a previous statement. There&#39;s a lot of types of iteration though, what to use? How do we apply iteration to lists? . Some methods include using a &quot;for loop&quot;, using a &quot;for loop and range()&quot;, using a &quot;while loop&quot;, and using comprehension . Lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets are iterable objects. They are the &#39;containers&#39; that store the data to iterate. . Each of these containers are able to iterate with the iter() command. . There are 2 types of iteration:definite and indefinite. Definite iteration clarifies how many times the loop is going to run, while indefinite specifies a condition that must be met . for variable in iterable: statement() . Iterator? Iterable? Iteration? . When an object is iterable it can be used in an iteration | When passed through the function iter() it returns an iterator | Strings, lists, dictionaries, sets and tuples are all examples of iterable objects. | . a = [&#39;alpha&#39;, &#39;bravo&#39;, &#39;charlie&#39;] itr = iter(a) print(next(itr)) print(next(itr)) print(next(itr)) . alpha bravo charlie . Loops . Well, above is basically just printing them again, so how do we takes these iterators into something we can make use for? | Loops take essentially what we did above and automates it, here are some examples. | . list = [&quot;Alpha&quot;, &quot;Bravo&quot;, &quot;Charlie&quot;, &quot;Delta&quot;, &quot;Echo&quot;, &quot;Foxtrot&quot;, &quot;Golf&quot;, &quot;Hotel&quot;, &quot;India&quot;, &quot;Juliett&quot;, &quot;Kilo&quot;, &quot;Lima&quot;, &quot;Mike&quot;, &quot;November&quot;, &quot;Oscar&quot;, &quot;Papa&quot;, &quot;Quebec&quot;, &quot;Romeo&quot;, &quot;Sierra&quot;, &quot;Tango&quot;, &quot;Uniform&quot;, &quot;Victor&quot;, &quot;Whiskey&quot;, &quot;X-ray&quot;, &quot;Yankee&quot;, &quot;Zulu&quot;] # using a for loop for i in list: #for item in the list, print the item print(i) . list = [&quot;Alpha&quot;, &quot;Bravo&quot;, &quot;Charlie&quot;, &quot;Delta&quot;, &quot;Echo&quot;, &quot;Foxtrot&quot;, &quot;Golf&quot;, &quot;Hotel&quot;, &quot;India&quot;, &quot;Juliett&quot;, &quot;Kilo&quot;, &quot;Lima&quot;, &quot;Mike&quot;, &quot;November&quot;, &quot;Oscar&quot;, &quot;Papa&quot;, &quot;Quebec&quot;, &quot;Romeo&quot;, &quot;Sierra&quot;, &quot;Tango&quot;, &quot;Uniform&quot;, &quot;Victor&quot;, &quot;Whiskey&quot;, &quot;X-ray&quot;, &quot;Yankee&quot;, &quot;Zulu&quot;] # Taking the length of the list lengthList = len(list) # Iteration using the amount of items in the list for i in range(lengthList): print(list[i]) . list = [&quot;Alpha&quot;, &quot;Bravo&quot;, &quot;Charlie&quot;, &quot;Delta&quot;, &quot;Echo&quot;, &quot;Foxtrot&quot;, &quot;Golf&quot;, &quot;Hotel&quot;, &quot;India&quot;, &quot;Juliett&quot;, &quot;Kilo&quot;, &quot;Lima&quot;, &quot;Mike&quot;, &quot;November&quot;, &quot;Oscar&quot;, &quot;Papa&quot;, &quot;Quebec&quot;, &quot;Romeo&quot;, &quot;Sierra&quot;, &quot;Tango&quot;, &quot;Uniform&quot;, &quot;Victor&quot;, &quot;Whiskey&quot;, &quot;X-ray&quot;, &quot;Yankee&quot;, &quot;Zulu&quot;] # Once again, taking the length of the list lengthList = len(list) # Setting the variable we are going to use as 0 i=0 # Iteration using the while loop # Argument saying WHILE a certain variable is a certain condition, the code should run while i &lt; lengthList: print(list[i]) i += 1 .

A 2D array is simply just a list of lists. The example below is technically correct but... . keypad = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [&quot; &quot;, 0, &quot; &quot;]] . Conventially 2D arrays are written like below. This is because 2D arrays are meant to be read in 2 dimensions (hence the name). Writing them like below makes them easier to visualize and understand. . keypad = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [&quot; &quot;, 0, &quot; &quot;]] . [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [&#39; &#39;, 0, &#39; &#39;]] . Printing a 2D Array . We already know that we can&#39;t just print the matrix by calling it. We need to iterate through it to print it. . def print_matrix1(matrix): for i in range(len(matrix)): # outer for loop. This runs on i which represents the row. range(len(matrix)) is in order to iterate through the length of the matrix for j in range(len(matrix[i])): # inner for loop. This runs on the length of the i&#39;th row in the matrix (j changes for each row with a different length) print(matrix[i][j], end=&quot; &quot;) # [i][j] is the 2D location of that value in the matrix, kinda like a coordinate pair. [i] iterates to the specific row and [j] iterates to the specific value in the row. end=&quot; &quot; changes the end value to space, not a new line. print() # prints extra line. this is in the outer loop, not the inner loop, because it only wants to print a new line for each row . print(&quot;Raw matrix (list of lists): &quot;) print(keypad) print(&quot;Matrix printed using nested for loop iteration:&quot;) print_matrix1(keypad) print() . Raw matrix (list of lists): [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [&#39; &#39;, 0, &#39; &#39;]] Matrix printed using nested for loop iteration 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 . def print_matrix2(matrix): for row in matrix: # Iterates through each &quot;row&quot; of matrix. Row is a dummy variable, it could technically be anything. It iterates through each value of matrix and each value is it&#39;s own list. in this syntax the list is stored in &quot;row&quot;. for col in row: # Iterates through each value in row. Again col, column, is a dummy variable. Each value in row is stored in col. print(col, end=&quot; &quot;) # Same as 1 print() # Same as 1 print_matrix2(keypad) . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 . More Functions . Try to find another way to print the matrix. Only complete one of the two (unless you&#39;d like to do both). Below is a hint . fruit = [&quot;apples&quot;, &quot;bananas&quot;, &quot;grapes&quot;] print(fruit) print(*fruit) # Python built in function: &quot;*&quot;. Figure out what it does . [&#39;apples&#39;, &#39;bananas&#39;, &#39;grapes&#39;] apples bananas grapes . NOTE: the * changes all the indices of the list into strings&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; def print_matrix3(matrix): code = &quot;your code goes here&quot; . Alternatively, find a way to print the matrix using the iter() function you already learned. Or use both! . HW Assignment Pt 1: . words = [&quot;alfa&quot;, &quot;bravo&quot;, &quot;charlie&quot;, &quot;delta&quot;, &quot;echo&quot;, &quot;foxtrot&quot;, &quot;golf&quot;, &quot;hotel&quot;, &quot;india&quot;, &quot;juliett&quot;, &quot;kilo&quot;, &quot;lima&quot;, &quot;mike&quot;, &quot;november&quot;, &quot;oscar&quot;, &quot;papa&quot;, &quot;quebec&quot;, &quot;romeo&quot;, &quot;sierra&quot;, &quot;tango&quot;, &quot;uniform&quot;, &quot;victor&quot;, &quot;whiskey&quot;, &quot;xray&quot;, &quot;yankee&quot;, &quot;zulu&quot;] inp = input(&quot;&quot;).lower() print(&quot;your word:&quot;, inp) print(&quot;&quot;) print(&quot;the NATO code:&quot;) letters = list(inp) for n in inp: for nato in words: if nato[0] == n: print(nato) . HW Assignment Pt 2: . # Keypad: keypad = [[&quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;3&quot;], [&quot;4&quot;, &quot;5&quot;, &quot;6&quot;], [&quot;7&quot;, &quot;8&quot;, &quot;9&quot;], [&quot; &quot;, &quot;0&quot;, &quot; &quot;]] m = 0 while m &lt; len(keypad): print(*keypad[m]) m = m + 1 . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 . HW Assignment Pt 3: . keyboard = [[&quot;`&quot;, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0, &quot;-&quot;, &quot;=&quot;], [&quot;Q&quot;, &quot;W&quot;, &quot;E&quot;, &quot;R&quot;, &quot;T&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;, &quot;U&quot;, &quot;I&quot;, &quot;O&quot;, &quot;P&quot;, &quot;[&quot;, &quot;]&quot;], [&quot;A&quot;, &quot;S&quot;, &quot;D&quot;, &quot;F&quot;, &quot;G&quot;, &quot;H&quot;, &quot;J&quot;, &quot;K&quot;, &quot;L&quot;, &quot;;&quot;, &quot;&#39;&quot;], [&quot;Z&quot;, &quot;X&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;V&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;N&quot;, &quot;M&quot;, &quot;,&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, &quot;/&quot;]] . Print what month you were born and how old you are by iterating through the keyboard (don&#39;t just write a string). . print(&quot;month:&quot;) print(keyboard[3][6], keyboard[2][0], keyboard[1][5]) print(&quot;&quot;) print(&quot;age:&quot;) print(keyboard[0][1], keyboard[0][6]) . month: M A Y age: 1 6 . HW Challenge: . Change all of the letters that you DIDN&#39;T print above to spaces, &quot; &quot;, and then print the full keyboard. (the things you did print should remain in the same spot) . Alternative Challenge: If you would prefer, animate it using some form of delay so it flashes one of your letters at a time on the board in order and repeats. (this one may be slightly more intuitive) . DO NOT HARD CODE THIS. Don&#39;t make it harder on yourself, iterate through, make it abstract so it can be used dynamically. You should be able to input any string and your code should work. . . 1 6 R A H C M . If you get stuck you can just make a picture with an array and print it (I will grade based on how good it looks) . I do expect an attempt so write some code to show you tried the challenge. . &lt;/div&gt; .",

            "content": "Lesson Overview: 3.5 - Boolean Expressions . Here we will focus on: basics of Booleans | its relationship with binary | relational operators | Logical Operators | . | . What is a boolean? . A data type with two possible values: true or false | . Boolean and Binary . So similar yet so different. . Boolean math and binary notation both use the same two ciphers: 1 and 0. | However, please note that Boolean quantities are restricted to a singlular bit (can only be either 1, or 0) | On the otherhand, binary numbers may be composed of many bits adding up in place-weighted form to any finite value, or size | . Must Knows . A Boolean value is either TRUE or FALSE | The AP Exam will provide you with a reference sheet with the operators below. | . A few ways these operators could be used... | . Relational Operators in action . How could you use operators to determine if the average of 5 grades is greater than 80? | . With the grades below, use boolean expressions to determine if the average grade is above an 80 and print the result (True or False) | Try it in as few steps as possible! | Be creative! There are obviously TONS of different practical solutions | . grade1 = 90 grade2 = 65 grade3 = 60 grade4 = 75 grade5 = 95 result = (grade1 + grade2 + grade3 + grade4 + grade5)/5 if result &gt; 80: print(&quot;true&quot;) else: print (&quot;false&quot;) . The versatility of relational operators: . print(&quot;100 == 100:&quot;,100==100) print(&quot;Hello == Adios:&quot;,&quot;greeting&quot;==&quot;farewell&quot;) print(&quot;Hello != Adios:&quot;,&quot;greeting&quot;!=&quot;farewell&quot;) print(&quot;Hello == Hola:&quot;,&quot;greeting&quot;==&quot;greeting&quot;) print(&quot;5&gt;=4:&quot;, 5&gt;=4) print (&#39;&#39;) # Notice that relational operators can even work on lists! # For lists, the relational operator compares each respective component until an answer is derived print(&quot;[&#39;a&#39;,&#39;b&#39;,&#39;c&#39;] &gt; [&#39;x&#39;,&#39;y&#39;,&#39;z&#39;]:&quot;, [&#39;a&#39;,&#39;b&#39;,&#39;c&#39;] &gt; [&#39;x&#39;,&#39;y&#39;,&#39;z&#39;]) print(&quot;[1,2,3,5] &gt; [1,2,3,4]:&quot;, [1,2,3,5] &gt; [1,2,3,4]) print(&quot;[1,2,3,5] &lt; [1,2,3,4]:&quot;, [1,2,3,5] &lt; [1,2,3,4]) print(&quot;[1,2,3,5] == [1,2,3,4]:&quot;, [1,2,3,5] == [1,2,3,4]) . Logical Operators! . These types of operators don&#39;t necessarily deal with equivalent/non-equivalent values, but they rather work on operands to produce a singular boolean result . AND : returns TRUE if the operands around it are TRUE | OR : returns TRUE if at least one operand is TRUE | NOT : returns TRUE if the following boolean is FALSE | . Turn the following arithmetic phrases into either True or False statements as indicated USING LOGICAL OPERATORS . print(&quot;1 &gt; 2 or 5 &lt; 12:&quot;, 1 &gt; 2 or 5 &lt; 12) # Output TRUE using OR ^ # Output FALSE using NOT print(&quot;24 &gt; 8:&quot;, not 24 &gt; 8,) # Output FALSE using AND print(&quot;10 &gt; 20:&quot;, 10 &gt; 20 and false) . Lesson Overview: 3.6 - Conditionals . Focusing on Selection . Selection: uses a condition that evaluates to true or false . Selection determines which part of an algorithm are executed based on a condition being true or false . Algorithm is a finite set of instructions that accomplish a specific task . Conditional Statements . Also known as &quot;if statements&quot; . Can be seen as if statements or if blocks . Can also be seen as if else statements or if else-blocks . x = 20 y = 10 if x &gt; y: print(&quot;x is greater than y&quot;) . x = 20 y = 10 if x &gt; y: print(&quot;x is greater than y&quot;) else: print(&quot;x is not greater than y&quot;) . Participation . -Calculate the total sum of two numbers, if it is equal to 200, print 200, if otherwise, print the sum. . num1 = 78 num2 = 106 sum = num1 + num2 if sum == 200: print(&quot;the sum is 200&quot;) else: print(&quot;the sum is not 200. Sum: &quot;), print(sum) . Lesson Overview - 3.7 Nested Conditionals . Nested conditional statements consist of conditional statements within other conditional statements | Utilizes &quot;if else&quot; statements within &quot;if else&quot; statements | . Basics of a nested conditional: | . Block Coding Visual of Nested Conditionals: | Example Psuedocode of Nested Conditional Statements | . Analyzing Code Walkthrough . Psuedocode to the left, block code to the right | Approach the problem by going through each condition one at a time . Decide which ones are false to skip and which ones are true to execute | . | You Try: . | . score = 82 if (score &gt;= 90) { console.log(&quot;You got an A, congrats!&quot;) } else { if (score &gt;= 75) { console.log(&quot;Please come to retake up to a 90 next week at tutorial!&quot;) } else { console.log(&quot;You have detention!&quot;) } } . protein = 25 carbs = 36 sugar = 11 if (carbs &gt;= 55 || protein &lt;= 20 || sugar &gt;= 15) { console.log(&quot;Your lunch is too unhealthy, please pick a new one&quot;) } else { if (carbs &lt; 35 || protein &lt; 25) { console.log (&quot;This lunch is alright but try to add some more carbs or protein&quot;) } else { if (sugar &gt;= 11) { console.log (&quot;Looks great but lets see if we can cut down on sugar, we don&#39;t want diabetes!&quot;) } else { console.log (&quot;Amazing, you created a healthy lunch!!!&quot;) } } } . note: the double lines || means OR . Writing Nested Code Activity . Write a program that fits these conditions using nested conditionals: If a person has at least 8 hours, they are experienced | If a person is experienced their salary is 90k, if they have ten hours or above their salary 150k | If a person is inexperienced their salary is always 50k | print the salary of the person at the end and whether they are experienced or not | . | hours= 7 if (hours &lt; 8) { console.log (&quot;This person is not experienced :(. Your salary is 50K&quot;) } else (hours &gt;= 8 &amp;&amp; hours &lt; 10) { console.log (&quot;This person is experienced, they have a salary of 90K&quot;) } else (hours &gt;= 10) { console.log (&quot;This person is very experiences, they have a salary of 150K&quot;) } .

A library is a collection of precompiled codes that can be used later on in a program for some specific well-defined operations. | These precompiled codes can be referred to as modules. Each module contains bundles of code that can be used repeatedly in different programs. | A library may also contain documentation, configuration data, message templates, classes, and values, etc. | . Why are libraries important? . Using Libraries makes Python Programming simpler and convenient for the programmer. | One example would be through looping and iteration, as we don’t need to write the same code again and again for different programs. | Python libraries play a very vital role in fields of Machine Learning, Data Science, Data Visualization, etc. | . A few libraries that simplify coding processes: . Pillow allows you to work with images. | Tensor Flow helps with data automation and monitors performance. | Matplotlib allows you to make 2D graphs and plots. | . The AP Exam Refrence Sheet itself is a library! . Hacks: .

Pseudocode: A blend of human language and coding format. | Hacks: Jamboard Flowchart . Click on this link for a group activity . . . Arithmetic Operations . Arithmetic operations exist in most programming languages. . Basic Operations . Subtraction: . Represented by “-&quot; | . num1 = 2 - 1 . Addition: . Represented by &quot;+&quot; | . num1 = 2 + 1 . Multiplication: . Represented by “*” | . num1 = 2 * 1 . Division: . Represented by “/” | . num1 = 2 / 1 . Getting the Remainder: . Represented by “MOD” (% in python) | . num1 = 5 % 2 . Different Uses . Items can be numbers or variables. . Examples: . num1 = 10 num2 = num1 - 25 num3 = 100 * num1 num4 = num1 / num2 num5 = 9 % num4 . Order of Operations . Arithmetic operations in programming are performed in the same order as operations in mathematics: . Operations in parentheses should be done first. . | Division and multiplication should be done before addition and subtraction. . | Modulus works similar to multiplication and division. . | . Example: Evaluate num1 . num1 = 9 % 2 * ( 8 - 2 ) + 8 / ( 6 - 4 ) print(num1) . 10.0 . . . Variables . Different Ways Values are Stored in Variables . Numerical value stored in a variable . | Value of another variable stored in a variable . | Result of an operation stored in a variable . | Result of a procedure call stored in a variable . | score = 0 # 1 score = newScore # 2 score = newScore + 2 # 3 avgScore = allscores(20, 60, 80) # 4 . Sequencing is Important! . Changing the order of the steps changes the overall outcome, since every time the value assigned to a variable is changed, it overrides the last value which was assigned to the same variable. That is why it is important to track the value of variables, especially in code where the value is constantly changing. . num1 = 2 num2 = 4 num3 = 6 num1 = num2 + num3 # num1 is now 4 + 6, which is 10 num2 = num1 + num3 # num2 is now (the new num1) 10 + 6, which is 16 # output: num1 = 10, num2 = 16, num3 = 6 . VS . num1 = 2 num2 = 4 num3 = 6 num2 = num1 + num3 #num2 is now 8 num1 = num2 + num3 # num1 is now 14 # output: num1 = 14, num2 = 8, num3 = 6 . Tracking Variables . Tracking variables is a common question found on AP exams and is an important thing to keep in mind when writing any code. If the value of your variables changes a lot, not accounting for these changes can result in an unwanted outcome. . var1 = 9 var2 = 7 var3 = 2 #var = var1 + 5 #var2 = var1 - var3 #var1 = var2 #var3 = (var1 + var2) / 2 #var2 = 6 print(var1) print(var2) print(var3) . Hacks/Homework . Evaluate the variable &quot;result&quot;. . Num1 = 50 Num2 = Num1 % 9 + 15 Num3 = Num2 / Num1 + ( Num2 * 2 ) Num4 = Num3 + Num1 / 5 - 10 Result = Num4 - Num2 . Num1 = 10 Num2 = Num1 % 3 * 4 Num1 = Num2 Num3 = Num1 * 3 Result = Num3 % 2 . valueA = 4 valueB = 90 valueC = 17 valueB = valueC - valueA valueA = valueA * 10 if valueB &gt; 10: print(valueC) . type = &quot;curly&quot; color = &quot;brown&quot; length = &quot;short&quot; type = &quot;straight&quot; hair = type + color + length print(hair) . . . Strings . What is a String? . A String: A string is a collection of characters. What is a character as character can be anything from numbers, letters, spaces, special symbols, etc. . A string is a collection of characters. What is a character as character can be anything from numbers, letters, spaces, special symbols, etc. . Certain procedures may be used with strings and they vary from programming language to language Python examples . len() to find the length of a string . lower() to convert to lowercase . etc. Pseudocode examples . len() returns the length of a string . concat() returns a string made up of the concatenated strings ex. concat(&quot;string1&quot;, &quot;string2&quot;) would return string1string2 . substring() returns the characters from the string beginning at the at the first position to the last so an example of this would be substring (&quot;abcdefghijk&quot;, 2, 5) would print bcde (pseudocode starts at 1) . String Concatenation . What is string concatenation? . String concatenation is combining 2 or more strings to make a new strings in order to create a new string . concat() in pseudocode and varys from language to language can be used to combine to strings such as concat(&quot;cookie&quot;,&quot;monster&quot;) returns cookiemonster . Substrings . What is a substring? . A substring is a part of and already existing string. . In pseudocode substring() method is used for instance for concat(&quot;Mr.Mortenson is very handsome&quot; 1, 2) the system would return Mr (remember that pseudocode starts at 1) . Hacks . Find the result of the following problems. Then convert the pseudocode to working python code using your knowledge of python string operators. . Problem 1 . Noun = &quot;Mr.Mortenson&quot; Adjective = &quot;handsome&quot; Adjective2 = &quot;Very&quot; Verb = &quot;is&quot; abrev = subtring(Noun, 1, 7) yoda = concat(Adjective2, &quot; &quot;, Adjective, &quot; &quot;, abrev, &quot; &quot;,Verb, &quot;.&quot;) display[yoda] . Problem 2 . cookie = &quot;choclate&quot; cookie2 = &quot;rasin&quot; len1 = len(cookie) / 2 len2 = len(cookie2) * 45 vote1 = (cookie, &quot;vote&quot;, len2) vote2 = (cookie2, &quot;vote&quot;, len1) votes = concat(vote1, &quot; &quot;, vote2) display[votes] .",

I liked how the one on the right has a snake. . . I also looked at some of the projects of other teams in our class. One project I thought was interesting was a group who made a game of hangman. . Project Ideas for Next Tri: . Our project seemed to have a lot more backend than frontend. So for our next project, it might be better to do something more like a game, since that would have more of a balance between backend and frontend. .

Covid19 RapidAPI Example . To begin the API journey. You need to find an API provider. . RapidAPI is a great option. You must setup and account, but there are many free options. | Goto this page for starters, the Corona virus World and India data- Under Code Snippets pick Python - Requests | . RapidAPI, you will select Python Requests type of code to work with you Notebook. . The url is the endpoint to which the API is directed | The headers is a dictionary data structure to send special messaging to the endpoint | The requests.request() python function is used to send a request and retrieve their responses | The response variable receives result of of the request in JSON text | . Next step, is to format the response according to your data science needs . &quot;&quot;&quot; Requests is a HTTP library for the Python programming language.

Hint: . write a “single” test describing an expectation of the program of the program | test - input burger, expect output of burger price | run the test, which should fail because the program lacks that feature | write “just enough” code, the simplest possible, to make the test pass | . Then repeat this process until you get program working like you want it to work. . menu = {&quot;burger&quot;: 3.99, &quot;fries&quot;: 1.99, &quot;drink&quot;: 0.99} total = 0 #shows the user the menu and prompts them to select an item print(&quot;Menu&quot;) for k,v in menu.items(): print(k + &quot; $&quot; + str(v)) #why does v have &quot;str&quot; in front of it? #ideally the code should prompt the user multiple times item = input(&quot;Please select an item from the menu&quot;) if item == &quot;burger&quot;: total = total + menu[&quot;burger&quot;] elif item == &quot;fries&quot;: total = total + menu[&quot;fries&quot;] elif item == &quot;drink&quot;: total = total + menu[&quot;drink&quot;] #code should add the price of the menu items selected by the user print(&quot;your total is:&quot;) print(total) . Menu burger $3.99 fries $1.99 drink $0.99 your total is: 0 . Hacks . Now is a good time to think about Testing of your teams final project... .

Video 3: . programers use somethign called program documentation to: . describe overall program | list specific functions of program | describe specific functions or code segments of program | list events and outputs | how others can interact with program | list contributers and other developers of program | . documentation happens: . at the beginning: list specifications | while programming to keep track of progress and issues | after to explain the overall process | . good documentation can improve: . efficiency | ability to fix issues/refine the program | response to bugs | . how to programmers document while programing: . most languages allow comments | comments are txt written within the program that are not executed and don’t affect the program | they are only for developers; computers skip over comments and they are not shown on actual product | comments can be useful when working w/ others, or even for yourself | . examples of comments: . python: # comments are written after the pound sign | java: // comments can be written on a single line using double / for multiple lines they must be done w /* on both sides of comment | javascript, c++ have comments similar to java | HTML uses comments like this: &lt;exclamation mark–comment–&gt; | .",

Applications: games, social media, etc | Physical devices: computers, phones, etc | Systems: e-commerce (online shopping), cloud services, e-mail | . smart “things”: anything that can communicate with your computer – smart phones, watches, doorbells, refrigerator, insulin detectors, etc . Guiding questions for when you’re innovating for a purpose: 1) Why does the computing innovation exist? 2) What problem(s) does the innovation solve? 3) What does the innovation allow us to do that we couldnt do before? . Examples: . Social media: Why does it exist? – as a form of communication, entertainment, news, archiving . What problems does it solve? – keeping up with friends who live a long distance apart was difficult and inconvenient . What does the innovation allow us to do? – quickly and efficiently keep tabs w/ friends; find out news and other peoples opinions on it; track progress easier . | Online shopping: Why does it exist? – to make shopping more convenient and available for everyone . What problems does it solve? – it allows people to shop when they might not have time or transportation; . What does the innovation allow us to do? – shop internationally, shop w/out having to leave our homes . | . Video 2 . input: data sent to a computer to be processed by a program | event: an action that gives input data to a program – can be generated when a key is pressed, a button is clicked, a program is started, etc | inputs (usually) affects the output of program | output is data sent from a program to a device | . types of inputs: . tactile (touch) | audio | visual | text (including numbers) | . example: smart phone/tablet: . touch screen: tactile – how you touch, where you touch, movements | physical buttons | audio: you can say things to your phone | visual: facial recognition | . how do programs receive input?: . programs are written in an event driven program | events are triggered by actions, and these actions usually send input to program | different types of “events” a user can trigger: button click, taps/swiping, keyboard entries, audio triggers | . input might not always affect output: if a phone is off clicking a button does nothing. You have to follow the correct sequence of events . types of outputs produced by device: . visual | audio | text | . how does a program know what to do when an event takes place?: . actions done by the user or another program can trigger events | program “jumps” to code segment related to specific events – code segment is executed and output is given | program is not necessarily executed in order that the lines are written in | . Video 3: . what is a program (also called software)? a program is a collection of statements: . statement: a single command code segment: group of statements – these statements are executed according to program rules . example: . min &lt;– alist[1] for EACH item in alist { IF (item &lt; min) { min &lt;– item } } DISPLAY (“The minimum number in the list is”) DISPLAY min . explanation: The code starts at item 1 in alist and assigns it to min. Then, for each number in the list after 1, if the number is less than min, it assigns the new number as min. At the end it prints the min # . what does this program do? . finds the minimum value in the list | . looking at the purpose, we have to find potential issues: . program would need to work for lists with #s out of order | what about negative numbers (should it take them into account?) | very large numbers; some languages might not allow large #s | decimals; some languages store decimals as a different type (not int) | . when describing code segment: . explain what it does so that others can insert it into larger programs | you could include how it does what it does (somebody might want to expand on it) | .",

It has a button that takes you you to the next question . | Changes Made: . Orininally the incorrect page took you to the starting page and the player had to start the quiz over.

            "content": "Alumni Panel Notes . Takeaways: . I originally took this class because I thought coding would be a niche skill that would be usefull in some cases but not that often. I am not planning on taking a career in CS in the future, so I was not that interested in learning code. However, during this meeting I realized that not only can the coding I learn be used in any field, but also the problem solving skills I develop | I also had been struggling during the first couple weeks in this class. I kept running into problems I didn’t how how to solve, and even when I solved them I was not sure how I did it. However, based on what the alumnis said, I learned CS is not as straightforward as other subjects. And there are answers on the internet for everything I come across, and I just need to have the perseverance and motivation to work through it | Coding is not just writing predetermined code, but requries creative thinking, and not every solution will be obvious | Most of the time I will find the best help within my team | Don’t be discouraged by others doing better, because everyone’s learning curve is different. At the same time, don’t take too much pride in your achievements | . Notes I took during the meeting: . How did you realize you wanna take your major and how did taking CSA and CSP help? . Hoped to get better at CS | Loved problem solving | Started from a young age | The ability to create new things using code | Like the complexity and being able to understand computers on another level | Didn’t necessarily like CS but realized its an important tool that is helpful to learn regardless of what field you are going into | Helps with web design | . Biggest challenges in CSP: . The beginning is difficult, but keeping your motivation is important to be able to overcome challenges | There is an answer somewhere on the internet | Stay humble, but don’t be discouraged | Going from high school CS to college CS is a lot different | Have a specific project to apply what you learn to | Google has a lot of answers | Temptation to find short-cuts and cut corners | There’s not always a rigid structure, things might be a little messy | . Project Based Learning: . Many CS classes have a project component | In larger (college) classes, teachers don’t have the time to give individual attention – form groups so that you can work through your problems together . | There are a lot of repetitive tasks that can made much more efficient using code | Coding is used everywhere | A lot of problem solving skills (not necessarily related to coding) | . Internships: . Have a resume | Apply in setp-nov | Ask small, local companies – their more likely to accept high schoolers | .",

Lessons that discuss this: . Lesson 4: | . . Dictionaries . Used to store values in pairs. The value on the left is the key while the value on the right is the value. A dictionary can&#39;t have duplicate keys with different values. . info = {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;Ekam&quot;, &quot;grade&quot;: 11, &quot;YOB&quot;: 2006} print(info[&quot;name&quot;]) #putting a key in square brackets causes the value to be printed . Lessons that discuss this: ?? . . Algorithms . A set of instructions that can can achieve a task . Lessons that discuss this: . Lesson 2 | . . Sequencing, Selection, and Iteration . Parts of an algorithm: . Sequencing: The specific order of the steps of an algorithm. Changing the sequencing can change the outcome | Selection: Making a decision (if this is true, do these steps.. if not, do these steps) | Iteration: Repeating a part of code for a defined number of times, or even forever (while loops) | . Lessons that discuss this: . Lesson 2 | . . Expressions: . Mathematical expressions that can be put into code . Operation Syntax . x + y | Addition | . x - y | Subtraction | . x * y | Multiplication | . x / y | Division | . x // y | Quotient | . x % y | Remainder | . x ** y | Exponentiation | . Lessons that discuss this: . Lesson 2 | . . Comparison Operators: . Used to compare two values with each other.. useful in Boolean expressions . Operator Description . &gt; | Greater than | . &lt; | Less than | . == | Equal to | . != | Not equal to | . &gt;= | Greater than or equal to | . &lt;= | Less than or equal to | . Lessons that discuss this: . Lesson 3 | . . Boolean Expressions and Selection/Iteration: . Boolean is whether something is true or false. Selections can be made based on boolean expressions, where different outcomes are given when something is true or false. One type of selection could be whether to repeat a certain loop or not, and the decision is made based on a Boolean expression. This could be achieved with while loops . num = 5 # selection: if num &lt; 100 : print(&quot;The number is small&quot;) else: print (&quot;The number is large&quot;) # iteration: while num &lt; 10: num = num + 1 print(num) . The number is small 6 7 8 9 10 . Lessons that discuss this: . Lesson 3 | . . Truth Tables: . Tables used to organize different possible combinations and whether they would be true or not based on the given parameters: . *Note: Binary can be used to represent T of F as well -- 0 is F and 1 is T . AND truth tables: Both A AND B must be true for the overall operation to be true | . . A B Outcome . F | F | F | . F | T | F | . T | F | F | . T | T | T | . OR truth tables: Either A OR B must be true for the overall operation to be true | . . A B Outcome . F | F | F | . F | T | T | . T | F | T | . T | T | T | . XOR truth tables: Either A OR B must be true for the overall operation to be true, except if both are true then the overall outcome is F again | . . A B Outcome . F | F | F | . F | T | T | . T | F | T | . T | T | F | . . Lessons that discuss this: . Mr. Mort&#39;s lesson.. Week 2 | . . Characters . Not talked about yet . A letter.. Python does not have a separate data type for characters, so single letters will still be considered a string (or a variable if its used for that) . . Strings: . A string is a type of value, that includes text. Strings are usually denoted by surrounding the text in quotation marks. Even numbers can be classified as strings if they&#39;re put in quotation marks . string = &quot;hello&quot; . Lessons that discuss this: . Lesson 1 | . . Length: . The function len() returns the amount of characters in a string. This can also be used for variables that have a string value. . len(&quot;supercalifragilisticexpialidocious&quot;) #this word has 34 characters, so the function should print 34 . 34 .
